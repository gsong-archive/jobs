# Creative Co-founder

Do you love to nurture a brand from concept to life?

Can you empathize with customer's problems and employ creative solutions to solve them?

Are you itching to work on a side project with proven market demand and realistic revenue model?

Kelsey and George are looking for you to complete the founding team of an e-commerce startup. We are turning an idea into the first product in an evergreen industry, aimed squarely at buyers who value meaningful experiences provided by local vendors over buying yet more stuff.

You will be the creative voice for the company, with Kelsey focusing on marketing and business development, and George focusing on product development. Together we will build our bootstrapped company, focusing on sustainable growth and profit, as well as an inclusive and nurturing environment.

Here are some immediate responsibilities you'll have:

* Name the company and the product
* Create our logo
* Create a lightweight style guide
* Design the initial marketing website

Reality check:

* You live in the Portland area, or plan to move here soon.
* There is no pay initially. As we start to become profitable (which we will pursue aggressively), the three of us will make joint decisions on fair compensation.
* Since this is a bootstrapped effort, we will do majority of the work ourselves. We will outsource smartly but sparingly.

Email us at <mailto:experience@monozuku.com> and tell us:

* How you're going to be an awesome part of this team!
* About your design philosophy and journey.
* Where we can see some of your work.

We'll set up a time to share more information about the research, planning, and work done so far. We would love to learn more about you, and for you to ask questions about us.
