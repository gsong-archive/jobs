# Contract Angular Developer

Have you kept up to date with Angular 1.5/2.0? Do you use JSPM or Webpack? Can you adapt to and improve on an existing develop, build, and release system? Have you shipped non-trivial production code?

If yes, then we want to talk to you about working on a few of our client projects for at least the next 2–3 months:

* Telecommunications patent related analysis apps
* Customer portal for an energy company
* A pioneering micro-grant distribution and tracking app

You should be able to contribute at least 15–20 hours each week. Starting rate of $70/hour, but will pay more if you are truly awesome.

Looking for Portland, Oregon locals or remote developers.

## Technical Skills You're Good At

* Writing ES6 or TypeScript
* Writing component based Angular app
* Using ui-router
* Using UI Bootstrap or Angular Material effectively, and do minor customizations via Sass
* Understanding what's important to test, and what's not

### Bonus

* Using the new component router 👍🏼
* Using Django REST Framework to build the API server 💪

## Non-technical Skills You're Good At

* Working steadily toward a milestone, instead of cramming everything in the last second
* Providing weekly project updates
* Communicating your needs in order to be successful
* Piping up if you see something that can be improved
* Pointing out stuff that doesn't make sense

## How Our Projects Are Set Up

* You know how to use Git, right? We rely heavily on pull requests for code reviews and to keep our code deployable at all times.
* We develop on the Mac and deploy on Linux. So you must be able to play nicely.
* We isolate our development environments using nvm, pyenv, etc.
* You shouldn't be afraid of installing Python, Node, Ruby and any packages needed for the projects.
* You must not be afraid of Terminal. We use command line based tools for development and build processes. We'll help you with set up and provide instructions as needed.

## Project Collaboration Tools We Use

Our main tools are Bitbucket, Slack, and Trello. You'll be expected to have
accounts for and use all three.

For remote voice communication, we use FaceTime, Skype, or Google Hangouts.
