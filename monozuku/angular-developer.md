# Contract Angular Developer

Have you kept up to date with Angular 1.5/2.0? Do you use JSPM or Webpack? Can you adapt to and improve on an existing develop, build, and release system? Have you shipped non-trivial production code?

If yes, then we want to talk to you about working on a few of our client projects for at least the next 2–3 months:

* Telecommunications patent related analysis apps
* Customer portal for an energy company
* A pioneering micro-grant distribution and tracking app

You should be able to contribute at least 15–20 hours each week. Starting rate of $70/hour, but will pay more if you are truly awesome.

Looking for Portland, Oregon locals or remote developers.

## You're Good At

* Writing component based Angular app
* Using ui-router (bonus if you know how to use the new component router)
* Using Bootstrap or Angular Material effectively, and do minor customizations via Sass
* Understanding what's important to test, and what's not
* Working steadily toward a milestone, instead of cramming everything in the last second
* Providing weekly project updates
* Communicating your needs in order to be successful on your projects
* Pointing out stuff that doesn't make sense in the UI
* Piping up if you see that something can be improved

## How Our Projects Are Set Up

* You know how to use Git, right? We rely heavily on pull requests for code reviews and to keep our code deployable at all times.
* We develop on the Mac and deploy on Linux. So preferably, you're developing on a Mac as well.
* We isolate our development environments using nvm, pyenv, etc.
* You shouldn't be afraid of installing Python, Node, Ruby and any packages we need for the projects.
* You must not be afraid of Terminal. We use command line based tools for development and build processes. We'll help you with set up and provide instructions as needed.

## Project Collaboration Tools We Use

Our main tools are Bitbucket, Slack, and Trello. You'll be expected to have
accounts for and use all three.

For remote voice communication, we use FaceTime, Skype, or Google Hangouts.

## Interested?

Please send an up-to-date résumé (keep it short and relevant) and cover letter to <mailto:jobs@monozuku.com>.

**No recruiters, please.**

## P.S.

If you know how to build using Django REST Framework, be sure to let us know.
